# Short-Text-Processing

The code mainly has two parts. The text processing part includes several functions in tranforming files in either `.xls` or `.txt` into
decent and readble python form, besides, it quantifies the words into matrices so that we can do further classification. The classification part has functions that utilize Kmenas to do the classification.

This project contains four files.

* `HSCODE_Clustering.py` is the code used in the entire project;

* `HS_CODE_Raw.xlsx` is the training set. Left column is the code of the product (class), right column is the description;

* `Short Text NLP.rmd` is the illustration of the introduction of GloVe, the dataset and the algorithm;

* `Short Text NLP.pdf` is the pdf form generated by `Short Text NLP.rmd`.
